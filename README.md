## How to Use

### 1. Customizing Content

All portfolio content is centralized in `src/Details.js`. Update the following exports:

- **`personalDetails`**: Your name, tagline, biography, and profile image
- **`workDetails`**: Array of work experiences with position, company, location, type, and duration
- **`eduDetails`**: Educational background and certifications
- **`projectDetails`**: Portfolio projects with title, description, tech stack, and links
- **`techStackDetails`**: Technologies and tools you work with
- **`socialMediaUrl`**: Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Instagram
- **`contactDetails`**: Email and phone number

### 2. Updating Assets

Place your assets in the appropriate folders:
- **Profile image**: `src/assets/profile.jpg`
- **Project images**: `src/assets/projects/project1.jpg`, etc.
- **Tech stack icons**: `src/assets/techstack/` (PNG/SVG format)

### 3. Modifying Branding

- **Gradient Logo**: Edit `src/assets/logo.svg` to adjust colors and design
- **White Logo**: Customize `src/assets/logo2.svg` for light backgrounds
- **Color Theme**: Modify Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`

### 4. Navigation Structure

The application includes five main routes (defined in `src/App.js`):
- `/` - Home page with hero section
- `/about` - Work experience and education timeline
- `/projects` - Portfolio project grid
- `/technologies` - Tech stack and development tools
- `/contact` - Contact information and links

### 5. Deploying the Website

```bash
npm build
```

This generates a production-ready build in the `build/` folder. Deploy to:
- **Netlify**: Use `public/_redirects` for SPA routing support
- **Vercel**: Automatic detection and deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Configure for static hosting

## How to Test

### 1. Manual Testing

**Browser Testing:**
```bash
npm start
```
- Navigate through all five routes using the header navigation
- Test mobile menu toggle on devices under 768px width
- Verify dark mode toggle (Tailwind dark mode class on root element)
- Check all external links (projects, social media, emails)

**Responsiveness:**
- Test on mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+)
- Verify layout adjustments with browser DevTools

**Dark Mode:**
- Toggle dark mode by adding `dark` class to the HTML element
- Verify all colors contrast properly with both light and dark backgrounds

### 2. Automated Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

This launches Jest and React Testing Library for component and integration tests.

### 3. Build Testing

Verify the production build:
```bash
npm build
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and verify the production build performs correctly.

### 4. Performance Audit

Use Google Chrome DevTools Lighthouse:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate to Lighthouse tab
3. Run audit for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
4. Address any warnings or errors

### 5. Content Validation

- Verify all text renders correctly without overflow
- Check image loading times and quality
- Validate external links are functional
- Test contact email and phone links work on target devices

### 6. Browser Compatibility

Test on multiple browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (v90+)
- Firefox (v88+)
- Safari (v14+)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
